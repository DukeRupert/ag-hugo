# My Build Composition for BG3 Patch 8

This next patch is due to introduce a new subclass for every class! I've been thinking a lot about what I want to run, and here is what I came up with. The full spreadsheet guide is linked at the bottom.

## Korgan Bloodaxe (Tav) – Giants Barbarian 6/ Gloomstalker 4/ Fighter 2

The new Path of Giants is shaping up to be the most powerful weapon striking subclass in the game! It plays into two of the most potent Larian homebrew cheese strats, namely, throwing attacks and the wet condition. Assuming it works as it does in table top, this class will be able to change their weapon's damage into an elemental type, which we can double against wet targets, hitting that double damage weapon attack threshold in Act 1 instead of Act 3. Its just too juicy to pass up, so I wanted my first build to utilize this subclass. 

Since the subclass allows you to give any weapon you wield the throw keyword, there are a lot of really good weapons to combine with it. I landed on Dwarven Thrower though. The extra 1d8, doubled against wet targets, and doubled again against large creatures is really strong. 

But that means we need to be a dwarf, so Duergar it is! At this point the full build began to lay itself out. If we're going to be a Duergar anyways, might as well go for upfront, round one burst damage, so Gloomstalker 4, Fighter 2 rounds out the levels. 

The narrative theme also came naturally. A raging, high damage duergar martial? That's Korgan Bloodaxe (a companion from BG2). Korgan is a dwarf, and dwarves live hundreds of years, so theoretically it makes sense for him to still be alive!

## Kerz Il-Khan (Hireling) - Hexblade 1/ Oath of the Crown 11

The new subclass for Paladins – Oath of the Crown – promises to offer probably the best suite of bonus spells ever. They get Command, Warding Bond, and Spirit Guardians. The combo of Warding Bond and Spirit Guardians gave me the notion that I could replace my typical Ultimate Cleric build with a mostly full class Paladin. 

If you are unfamiliar with my cleric build, the gist is to combine self-healing, Warding Bond, and Radiant Orb equipment to make the whole team unkillable. In theory, this Paladin can do all the same things, but maybe better? Radiant damage on their attacks with Smite and Improved Smite will spread radiant orb consistently, but they also have a few casts of Spirit Guardians if they need it. 

With Periapt of Wound Closure, Ring of Regeneration, Shattered Flail, and Extra Attack they will be reliably healing 16 HP per round, and can function like a health battery a'la my Queenguard Karlach build. The healing also perma triggers on-heal effects like Blade Ward and Bless from equipment.

And the kicker is their damage should actually be pretty good if we throw in a one level dip into the new Hexblade Warlock. It will give them tons of accuracy adding both your proficiency bonus and charisma instead of strength. Moreover, increased critical threat range and healing that scales with charisma on kill. With Deadshot, Sarevok's Helmet, and Elixir of Viciousness they are consistently criting on a 16+ roll, setting up for those deadly smites! This is what solidified Half-Orc as my race pick. Gotta get that crit damage!

Oh, and don't forget about Aura of Protection!

## Xan (Hireling) - Bladesinger 11/ White Draconic Sorcerer 1 

The new Bladesinging Wizard subclass might finally kick the Swords Bard from their throne of most powerful class in the game. I'm not sure it's the best way to build it, but I have a notion that you can copy and paste my Retaliation Wizard build and replace the subclass with Bladesinging. It should work almost as well. 

Obviously, Bladesingers don't have the same absurd damage reduction as Abjuration Wizards, but they do have some! At level 10 they gain the following:

> Song of Defense  
> Beginning at 10th level, you can direct your magic to absorb damage while your Bladesong is active. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to expend one spell slot and reduce that damage to you by an amount equal to five times the spell slot's level.

I could see this working almost as well, but only testing will tell. 

What Bladesingers do better then Abjuration Wizards is stacking Arcane Acuity through weapon attacks. They get Extra Attack at level 6, then with Duellist's Prerogative, we're looking at 3 attacks per round (although the bonus action attack competes with Band of the Mystic Scoundrel). So Helmet of Arcane Acuity and we're laughing!

Even if the retaliation gambit doesn't work, this class is still an Extra Attack full caster, but now with the Wizard spell list... Its honestly too good. 

## Jaheira - Land Druid 12

To round the composition off, I needed a class that can cast Create Water and, late game, Conjure Elemental to enable all the cold damage. There is also a Hat of Fire Acuity I haven't used. The obvious candidate is some kind of Druid, and I opted for a simple full class Land Druid build, because I still consider that the best way to build Druids. 

There's not much to say about this build. There's nothing clever about it, it just does exactly what the rest of the composition needs. 

## The Original Series Connection

However, old-school Baldur's Gate enjoyers will notice that all the characters in my composition are characters from the original games!

* Korgan Bloodaxe is a companion from BG2
* Xan is a companion from BG1, and the Bladesinger subclass is practically made for him!
* Jaheira is, of course, a returning character from the original series, and I kept her as a Druid
* Kerz Il-Khan is technically NOT actually a character from the original games. I thought about naming him DORN Il-Khan, after the Enhanced Edition companion. A evil paladin + warlock honestly fits him perfectly. But sadly, Dorn would be dead. Half-Orcs don't live that long. So I made this character a descendent of the Il-Khan bloodline. That will have to be good enough.

I am sure things will change once I see how Larian implements these new subclasses, but for now its just fun to speculate! Let me know your thoughts!

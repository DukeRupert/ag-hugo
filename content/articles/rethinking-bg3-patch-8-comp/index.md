# Rethinking my BG3 Patch 8 Comp

*Posted 5 days ago*

Testers of Patch 8 are reporting their findings on the new content, and now that I've seen a little clearer how Larian is implementing these features I've decided to plan out a new composition.

## Initial Changes

The gist is that the Path of Giant's barbarian isn't nearly as overpowered as it seemed like it would be. That is good for the overall health of the game, so I'm not disappointed! But I also don't feel as inspired to use one in my run as I was before, so I abandoned that build.

Abandoning the giants barb also made it not as necessary to include the full-class land druid, since now wet-blasting isn't the main identity of the comp, so I ditched that too.

I still want to run the crown paladin and bladesinger wizard, but you'll see I made a few tweaks to those builds as well to make them fit the new identity of the comp but will talk more about that later.

## The New Dark Urge Build

The comp I've landed on now is centered around the following Dark Urge build I dreamt up and am super excited to test!

### Voldemort – Shadow Sorcerer 9 / Necromancy Wizard 2 / Death Cleric 1

Yes! That's right! We're rolling up a Dark Lord! Practically all the goth and emo classes feature in this build, and you better believe his color scheme is going to reflect that.

I wanted to make a build for the shadow sorcerer after I saw how Larian is implementing the Hound of Ill Omen. The tantalizing feature is Ominous Bite, which has the chance to place an omen on the target. The omen will mark the target for 3 turns with an elemental damage type – acid, cold, fire, lightning, thunder, and poison - and in those three turns any instance of that damage type dealt to the target returns a sorcery point to the shadow sorcerer.

As far as I can tell, which element is selected for the omen is random, but this can still be exploited to return a metric crap-load of sorcery points. For example, say you roll the fire omen. Now you cast Scorching Ray, max upcasted. Your other party member dip their weapons in candles and go to town. You should be able to fully restore your sorcery points to full, and if you really need that max Scorching Ray spell slot back, you can use some of the recovered sorcery points to regen it. The hound refreshes on short rest, so, with some luck, the amount of sorcery points you can use on this class could be triple or more what a standard sorcerer gets. I have to try it!

### Class Dip Explanations

#### Death Cleric
The Death Domain gets the Reaper feature at level 1. Necromancy cantrips now hit two targets instead of one, effectively doubling their value. Two new and interesting necromancy cantrips have also been added to support this feature: Bursting Sinew and Toll the Dead. Both look good, but I still think just using Bone Chill should be the most effective, due to its synergy with the Boots of Stormy Clamour and the Spineshudder Amulet. Now with just a single level dip we get a decent DPR strategy and a highly efficient way to spread Reverberation. The hound's Ominous Bite require a con save to land the omen, so spreading Reverberation is essential for us anyways.

It also raises an interesting question, what is the interaction between Twin Spell and this new Reaper feature? Does each fork of the Twin Spell fork again with Reaper? If so, that is 4 spell attack on a single action with the low cost of 1 sorcery point (we'll just get it back with our goodest boi summon). We can't know until we test it, but even if it doesn't work we can still get 4 spell attacks per round with Quicken Spell. It will cost an extra bonus action and 3 sorcery points instead of 1, but still really good! And what if we cast Haste on ourselves? We're up to 6 Bone Chills, maybe more. Elixir of Bloodlust? Who knows where we are at now, but it's a lot!

#### Necromancy Wizard
If we're going to be throwing Bone Chills like a boxer throws hands, an Act 3 Staff of Cherished Necromancy seems like an easy choice for our weapon. Once we get it, every Bone Chill kill will give us charge to use a max upcasted Inflict Wounds. This is the point where the 2 level dip into wizard starts making sense. Grim Harvest scales with spell level, not wizard level. If we finish a target with Inflict Wounds, that's 18 health. It will add up.

Honestly, the wizard levels are probably not worth it, since we're losing 6th level spells on the sorc, and that means Globe of Invulnerability (remember, I ban the wizard scribe scroll exploit). Grim Harvest isn't that important, I just loved the idea of being a sorcerer/wizard/cleric all in one build. Wizard also lets us get Shovel in Act 1, and what's a Dark Lord without his sinister devil sidekick?

## The Rest of the Comp

After planning Voldemort it was irresistible to build the rest of the squad to be an evil Darkness comp.

### Modified Crown Paladin/Hexblade
For the Oath of the Crown/Hexblade build, I put one extra level in Hexblade to get the Devil Sight Invocation. I also swapped out Luminous Armor for the Dark Justiciar drip and made the unit Shadowheart instead of a hireling.

### Evil Bladesinger
For the Bladesinger I just swapped in the Eversight Ring (again, for the Darkness immunity) and made the unit Astarion. Evil comps need a vampire.

### Goth Beastmaster
The last unit might surprise you! I opted for a Beastmaster ranger and use the raven companion. Ravens are obviously super goth, so... But they're also just overlooked as part of Darkness comps. At high levels, the raven creates darkness clouds every time it flies, completely action economy and spell slot free. Ravens are also immune to blindness, so they fit right in.

Another interesting advantage of late game raven companions is that they can summon more ravens at-will. This allows you to create a lot of expendable ravens. Each raven also does piercing damage, which we can double with Bhallists Armor. It adds up to a lot of damage.

So that solidifies the beastmaster build. It will go Bhallist Armor and piercing damage. There is one stand out weapon to choose: Shar's Spear of Evening, which makes us immune to blindness and deals piercing damage.
